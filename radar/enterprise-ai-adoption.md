# Beyond the Hype in the "Pilots Are Failing" article (and more importantly, what the 5% knows)

You’ve probably seen the headline from outlets like [*Fortune*](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/): a staggering **95% of enterprise GenAI pilots are failing**, delivering zero measurable return. It’s a statistic that seems to confirm the fears of a hype bubble bursting.

But the headline, while accurate, misses the real story.

A new report from MIT's [Project NANDA](http://nanda.media.mit.edu), titled "The GenAI Divide," provides a critical, in-depth look at this widespread failure. The problem isn't the technology itself—it's that most organizations are deploying it incorrectly. The report reveals a stark chasm—the "GenAI Divide"—between the 5% of firms extracting millions in value and the 95% stuck in what amounts to expensive [science projects](https://hbr.org/2020/04/a-radical-solution-to-scale-ai-technology).

After digging into the 26-page report, it's clear the core issue isn't model quality, data readiness, or risk aversion. It’s something far more fundamental.

## The Real Culprit: A Massive "Learning Gap"

The report's central argument is that most GenAI pilots stall because the systems suffer from a critical **"learning gap"**. They are static, brittle, and forgetful. While employees love consumer-grade tools like ChatGPT for their flexibility in ad-hoc tasks, they abandon enterprise tools that can't learn, adapt, or remember context from one session to the next.

The research is unambiguous:

  * Over 65% of users cited "**It doesn’t learn from our feedback**" as a primary barrier to integrating AI into core workflows.
  * Another 62% pointed to the need to provide "**Too much manual context each time**".
  * When it comes to high-stakes, complex work, users prefer a human junior colleague over an AI by a **9-to-1 margin**. The reason? Memory and adaptability.

This explains the paradox at the heart of the GenAI Divide: employees are already using AI successfully. A thriving **"shadow AI economy"** exists where over 90% of employees use personal LLM subscriptions for work tasks, even while official, company-sanctioned pilots wither on the vine. Employees know what good AI feels like, and they are rejecting expensive enterprise tools that feel like a major step backward.

## Misaligned Investments and the "Buy vs. Build" Fallacy

So, where is the $30-40 billion in enterprise GenAI investment going? According to the report, it's being systematically misallocated.

Executives allocate a hypothetical 70% of GenAI budgets to visible, top-line functions like sales and marketing, where KPIs like "demo volume" are easy to measure. However, the report’s analysis of successful deployments shows the most dramatic and sustainable ROI comes from **back-office automation**. Companies crossing the divide are generating millions in savings by reducing BPO contracts and external agency spend—not by chasing vanity metrics in the front office.

The implementation strategy is just as critical. The data reveals a clear winner in the "[buy vs. build](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://a16z.com/buy-vs-build-the-eternal-question-for-the-generative-ai-era/)" debate, and it's not the approach most engineering-proud organizations would expect.

  * **Strategic partnerships ("Buy") are twice as likely to succeed** as internal builds, with a \~67% successful deployment rate compared to just \~33% for in-house efforts.
  * The most successful buyers don't treat vendors like SaaS providers; they treat them like **business service providers**. They demand deep workflow customization, co-evolution, and hold vendors accountable for operational outcomes, not software benchmarks.

## Crossing the Divide: The Path Forward

The report is not a eulogy for enterprise AI; it’s a playbook. The 5% of organizations on the right side of the divide are not just luckier—they are more strategic.

They prioritize **learning-capable systems** that retain context and improve over time. They empower frontline managers who are close to the actual pain points to source and champion solutions, rather than relying on centralized innovation labs.

The window to get this right is closing. Executives believe that vendor relationships for these learning-capable systems will be locked in over the next 18 months. Once an organization invests months into training a system on its proprietary data and workflows, the switching costs become immense.

This is leading to the rise of what the report calls the "Agentic Web", an interconnected ecosystem where specialized, learning agents collaborate to execute complex business processes autonomously, enabled by emerging protocols like NANDA and the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.anthropic.com/news/evolving-human-ai-interaction-a-vision-for-the-future-with-model-context-protocol). This is the next frontier, moving beyond simple prompts to a world of autonomous, protocol-driven coordination.

The 95% failure rate isn't an indictment of GenAI, but an indictment of deploying static, unintelligent systems to solve dynamic, complex problems. The organizations that thrive will be those that stop buying wrappers and start investing in systems that learn.
